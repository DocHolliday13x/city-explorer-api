# City Explorer API

* *Author*: Ryan Eastman

* *Version*: 1.0.0

## Project Overview

* *Description*: City Explorer is a Code Fellows 301 Lab exercise in which we will create our first true Full-Stack application. city-explorer is the front-end application, and city-explorer-api will be our backend application that will be our server for our application. To build our API, we will utilize a library called Express.js as well as Node.js. We will be using classes to simplify bulky data. After we have built our server, we will deploy it to Render and connect our React App on Netlify to the back-end at Render.

* *Current State of Development*: Initial Setup

## Lab 07

Today I will be creating a back-end server for our City Explorer project. Today's operation will be a little different. I created the repo on GitHub along with a README file. I then cloned the repo down to my local machine, and used the terminal command "npm init" to create a new project (this one). I used "npm install express/dotenv/cors" to add some more files, then manually generated and populated everything else. After my initial setup is complete (which is being done on a branch named setup rather than on the main), I will create a branch to commence my work on. The order of operations for today is layed out on a Trello board.
